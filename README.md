# Stacks Arcade

A playground of small Clarity mini-games with a Next.js frontend.

## Agents

If you're an agent working in this repo, start with `AGENTS.md` for the project workflow, micro-iteration protocol, and checkpoints. For Stacks docs and integration guidance, see `stacks/AGENTS.md`. Frontend and contract subfolders each have their own `AGENTS.md` to remind you where to look.
